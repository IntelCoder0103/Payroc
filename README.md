## The Problem
Context: You are hosting a dinner party for your developer friends and you just realised that the shops are closed
and you can only cook with the ingredients available at your house.
You: You, a React front-end developer, and your friends have this great idea to create an app that can be used by
anybody in similar situations. Your friend is a back-end developer and he assures you he can create a RestAPI that
will return recipes if you query it with the following parameters: ingredients, quantity, available cooking time,
number of ingredients and meal type.
Your big idea: Whatâ€™s your plan on building this application in order to convince your friend to go into business
together?
Let's go.
